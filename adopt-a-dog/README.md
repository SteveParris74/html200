TESTING:

Chrome:

Header - Dog image off center… could be better.  Location of shopping cart and checkout button could be better aligned per the mockup.  Font colors could be better.  Font choice not very close to mockup.  Navigation header looks good in full screen mode, cuts off slightly in iPad and Pixel mode.  Navigation text does not wrap very well in any size other than full screen mode.

Index page - dog tiles look good but are not consistently the same size. Murphy dog being a prime example. No hover effects on the tiles or Adopt buttons.   Show more dogs button is not the correct size or color. Media queries work well with scaling.  

Blog - Images not scaling at all correctly.  Something is way off here.

Dogs -  Images and tiles are not consistently sized, but media queries working well.  Somehow does not look ideal on iPad version in Inspector.
